# My-pystudy
A start of my pystudy，
Because of my poor English，I don't know what is a README.
Emmm...So after I set up my-pystudy repository a week，I begin to write this.

I'll add all my python codes into this repository during these days when I'm studying python.
And I may add other codes here，such as C and Java.
Of course I'll build a new repository for them.

Anyway，all my pystudy homework and some exercises will be here.
( In expectation of my book <<Introduction to Algorithms>> )
Hhhhh，I want to change the branch name 'master' to 'beginer'. But I don't find the way.
