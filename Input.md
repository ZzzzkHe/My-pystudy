Maybe I need to be more focused on my courses.
Emmm....The function of Input can be got easily.
Input in Python is only for strings.
So we can add 'eval' to help input numbers.

For example,
We can change Line 16-18(3.md) to these:
a=eval(input('输入二次项系数a：'))
b=eval(input('输入一次项系数b：'))
c=eval(input('输入常数项c：'))

I want to know more about why this happens. ^_^
