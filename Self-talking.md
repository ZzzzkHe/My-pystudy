Emmm...
I'm really confused about how to study.
I decided to keep my Github up-to-date everyday, but I find this goal hard to reach.
Data structures and algorithms are what I'm going to learn.
However, I asked myself how to start many times and I have no answer.
Sigh...
Rome was not built in a day.
Maybe I need to be more optimistic. 
There are a lot of days left.
I can take my time to do what I want to do.
Hhhh...
And I can practice my English here, yeah? ^_^

Good night to myself.

Again.

Again and again.

Today I'm doing something else.
